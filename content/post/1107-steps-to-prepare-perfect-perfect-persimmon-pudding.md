The persimmon is a fascinating fruit - and rather mild when it comes to flavor, making it the perfect star ingredient for an infinitely dense dessert that pulls you into it&#39;s spice-laden depths like any good winter treat. A note for this recipe: make sure the persimmons you&#39;re using are quite literally, mush. Finding the perfect persimmon is like finding the perfect peach. Persimmons must be very ripe and the insides look like jelly. After cleaning and taking off the stem, they are cut into chunks, skin and all, and pureed in a food processor.
