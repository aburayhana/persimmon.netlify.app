I love their pasta, their tiramisu and the fact that when you order some of their entrees, you get a second one to bring home with you. Anna would shape her cookies in rings. I like to shape these cookies in a S shape. If you like, you can also shape them into mini sized twists (just like these Lemon Ricotta Cheese Cookies di Chef Luca). Or, you can just leave them as logs.
