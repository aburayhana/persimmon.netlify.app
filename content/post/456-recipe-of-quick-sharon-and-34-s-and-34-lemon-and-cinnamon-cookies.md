I love their pasta, their tiramisu and the fact that when you order some of their entrees, you get a second one to bring home with you. I like to shape these cookies in a S shape. If you like, you can also shape them into mini sized twists (just like these Lemon Ricotta Cheese Cookies di Chef Luca). Or, you can just leave them as logs. This is a soft and pliable dough, that can be shaped in a variety of ways.
