This pudding cake is super moist and chewy, similar to an English toffee pudding cake. The persimmon fruit is a very mild tasting fruit, especially when it&#39;s baked, so I added some cinnamon and brown sugar to make it more flavorful. I used a hard and unripe persimmon, but it&#39;s best with a very ripe persimmon. This pound cake is incredible and completely reminds me of fall with every bite. Using sparkling apple cider in the batter and the glaze gives it a delicious and unique flavor.
