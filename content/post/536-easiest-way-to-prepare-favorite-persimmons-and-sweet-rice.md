I used Hachiya persimmons I got at the health food store. If you&#39;re not familiar with persimmons they are very soft when ripe, like a water balloon. Go back to the Divine Child and give her the persimmon, and she&#39;ll give you a key item called Rice for Kuro.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook persimmons and sweet rice using 10 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Persimmons and sweet rice:

1. Make ready  cooked short grain white rice
1. Take  + 2 tablespoons nonfat milk

They range in flavor from the flat and insipid to the sweet and delectable. Persimmon is a fruit popular in Asia, though not as commonly known in the U. Sweet persimmons are usually OK, but more astringent persimmons contain high amounts of tannins, which can slow the movement of food through the intestines, and aggravate constipation. If you do eat persimmons, stick to the sweet variety.

Place the persimmons in a brown paper bag with an apple or a banana. The ethylene gas apples and bananas produce speeds up the ripening process. Persimmons ripen differently than other fruits, so paper bag or banana won&#39;t help. Expect to wait for several weeks for a really hard persimmon to ripen. One of the things that affects the most how they ripen and even if they do ( and their flavor) is when they are picked.
