If you do eat persimmons, stick to the sweet variety. They range in flavor from the flat and insipid to the sweet and delectable. Persimmons ripen differently than other fruits, so paper bag or banana won&#39;t help. Expect to wait for several weeks for a really hard persimmon to ripen. One of the things that affects the most how they ripen and even if they do ( and their flavor) is when they are picked.
