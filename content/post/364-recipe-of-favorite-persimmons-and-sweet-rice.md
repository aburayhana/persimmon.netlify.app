They range in flavor from the flat and insipid to the sweet and delectable. Persimmon is a fruit popular in Asia, though not as commonly known in the U. Sweet persimmons are usually OK, but more astringent persimmons contain high amounts of tannins, which can slow the movement of food through the intestines, and aggravate constipation. If you do eat persimmons, stick to the sweet variety.

Place the persimmons in a brown paper bag with an apple or a banana. The ethylene gas apples and bananas produce speeds up the ripening process. Persimmons ripen differently than other fruits, so paper bag or banana won&#39;t help. Expect to wait for several weeks for a really hard persimmon to ripen. One of the things that affects the most how they ripen and even if they do ( and their flavor) is when they are picked.
